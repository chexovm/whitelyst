This is a MERN stack app built for my clients that want a website where people can apply for their Discord server roles.

To set up an app for the client:

/client:

- Adjust meta tags/media in /public (keywords, titles, icon, etc.) and style the app how the client wants it
- set variables in .env

/server:

- server/controllers: change roles according to the Discord server and the application types in each file
- set variables in .env
