          <h1>Server Rules:</h1>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <h3>Server language</h3>
              <p>Server language is primarily English</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>Mic and mic abuse</h3>
              <p>
                We want crystal-clear communication, so make sure your
                microphone and audio processing equipment are of professional
                standards. No ambient sounds, and try to reduce background
                noise!
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>Stay in character</h3>
              <p>
                If you spot some rule-breaking during an in-game scene, stay in
                character until it's over. Once the scene is over, drop the info
                in our community Discord so we can handle it. No breaking
                character and going OOC during a rule break!
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>Suicidal RP</h3>
              <p>
                ABSOLUTELY NO self-harm or suicide roleplay. This style of
                roleplay is frowned upon and will lead to a permanent ban. Life
                is precious, keep things positive!
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>Roleplaying skills</h3>
              <p>
                If our staff thinks your roleplaying skills need a little boost,
                they might bring you in for a friendly chat. But if you're still
                not up to the caliber of the server, you might face a temporary
                or permanent ban. Time to level up, my friends!
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>RDM (Random Deathmatch)</h3>
              <p>
                Say no to RDM (Random Deathmatch)! Attacking or killing other
                players without a legit in-character reason is not acceptable.
                No running people over, shooting without cause, or using
                explosives to harm others. If you want to purely PvP there is a
                designated on sight PVP RED ZONE in Paleto, it's an open PVP and
                non-engagement required zone. High risks call for high rewards.
                Any PVP outside of the Paleto Red Zone REQUIRES PROPER
                ENGAGEMENT AND PURPOSE! Red Zone is ANY Red Zone, and is not
                limited to Paletto..... There will be other Red Zones introduced
                and will identified on your Maps.... These are PVP Zones...
                please be alert to that.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>VDM (Vehicle Deathmatch)</h3>
              <p>
                VDM (Vehicle Deathmatch) is a bannable offense. Your wheels are
                for getting around, not mowing down zombies or players. No
                unnecessary ramming, purposefully blocking paths, or using
                vehicles as weapons. Let's keep it safe and fun for everyone!
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>Metagaming</h3>
              <p>
                Metagaming is NEVER ACCEPTABLE! Absolutely no use of
                out-of-character knowledge can be used in-game. That means no
                peeking at Discord, Twitch, or any other communication methods
                to get an unfair advantage. And keep your OOC talk to a minimum!
                Your character only knows what they've learned in-game and
                nowhere else. META GAMING IS AN IMMEDIATE BAN!
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>Powergaming</h3>
              <p>
                Powergaming: Don't force your actions or abilities onto other
                players without their consent. Keep it real and respect the
                contributions of your fellow roleplayers. Don't use flaws of
                in-game mechanics for a character advantage or personal gain.
                Mechanic abuse or taking advantage of systems is an immediate
                ban.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>Offline Raiding</h3>
              <p>
                Offline Raiding - Base raiding will be allowed IF and WHEN there
                is an actual story or RP driven purpose for the raid. If the
                person/group you are raiding is currently offline/asleep you are
                NOT allowed to start the raid until it is clear that both
                parties are available. This isn't Rust, we're all about being
                fair to everyone. Let's have fun and not grief each other.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>Exploiting/Cheating/Hacking</h3>
              <p>
                No exploiting or cheating. We're all about fair RP. No hacks,
                mods, glitches, or taking advantage of game mechanics. If you
                are found using any exploit or 3rd party software you will be
                immediately removed from the community. If you find a bug or
                exploit, report it to a staff member VIA DISCORD!
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>Value of life/Fear RP</h3>
              <p>
                If someone is waving a weapon at you, or you're outnumbered,
                show some fear! It's all about acting real and in the moment.
                Roleplay fear when put in the situation.A gun to the face is no
                joke, take it serious.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>Groups/gangs/crews</h3>
              <p>
                During aggressive scenes or hunting parts, the maximum number of
                people in your crew is six members. That way, everyone gets a
                fair shake! You can have as many members as you want in your
                groups/gangs/crew, but only six can go all-in during aggressive
                hunting/farming parties. When defending your gang/crew compound
                all available members can defend, but only six can go out on
                hunting parties. The maximum party size for ANY group outside of
                a SafeZone or base is 6 people. You are allowed to have more
                people in your crew as you'll find out in RP.... but for
                venturing into any other area or place... 6 is the limit!
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>Roleplay before gunplay</h3>
              <p>
                We're all about those deep, meaningful interactions. Save the
                shootouts and violence for a storyline. Connect with your fellow
                players and let the story unfold! Conflict RP happens, but don't
                go blasting other players without a valid reason or to avoid
                roleplay.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>Roleplay out those injuries</h3>
              <p>
                When your character gets hurt, make it count! Roleplay out those
                injuries like a pro. Consider the severity and how it
                realistically affects your character. For serious injuries like
                gunshot wounds, show the struggle, pain, and seek medical help
                from other players. No superhuman feats, if you get hurt RP IT
                OUT.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>Respect is key</h3>
              <p>
                Engage in realistic and immersive roleplay at all times. Stay
                in-character, speak the language, and follow the server's lore
                and setting. If you're in an active roleplay scene, stick with
                it unless it's a real OOC emergency. When in doubt, ask a staff
                member or consult the server's documentation.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>Pocket wiping</h3>
              <p>
                No pocket wiping! During a robbery or criminal activity. If you
                gun someone down in a PVP zone, you can choose the items you
                want out of their bag that was used in that conflict. OR you can
                steal someone's bag, but you can expect it to happen right back
                to you! Treat looting, how you would like to be looted.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>Drive realistically</h3>
              <p>
                Drive realistically, especially during car chases. Consider the
                type of car you're in and how it would actually perform in
                certain situations. No crazy jumps and unrealistic maneuvers.
                We're all about realism while driving a car!
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>Serial killer RP</h3>
              <p>
                Serial killer RP is a no-go. We're all about serious and
                realistic roleplay, not going on murder sprees
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>Toxic behavior</h3>
              <p>
                Toxic behavior is not acceptable and is a bannable offense. Show
                respect to your fellow players and staff members. No hate
                speech, trolling, or any other toxic behavior. We're all about
                good energy and zero tolerance for harassment or discrimination.
                Toxic behavior also includes forms of spawn camping, base
                camping, repeated PVP to the same target in a short window. THIS
                IS A BANNABLE OFFENSE
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>ERP (erotic roleplay)</h3>
              <p>
                We're all about the fun, but let's keep things PG. No ERP
                (erotic roleplay) IT'S NOT ALLOWED. Keep it clean and
                appropriate for all players. Violation of this rule comes with
                severe consequences, including permanent bans. If you are a part
                of something that makes you uncomfortable, please bring it to
                STAFF!
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>Staff decisions</h3>
              <p>
                Remember, staff decisions are the final word. If they make a
                call, respect it and follow through. If you disagree, there's an
                appeal process in place.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>Downed/New Life</h3>
              <p>
                If a player is downed by a zombie or accidental death (i.e.
                starving, falling down a cliff, etc..) and they are not in
                active conflict or combat and they have to use the revive
                option, their memories are in tact and can return to try and
                find their belongings. If a player is downed while in a RP or
                PvP conflict, whether it be a shootout or melee combat, if that
                person is downed and not treated for their wounds, that person
                will not remember anything after using the revive option.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>Tsunami Shenanigans</h3>
              <p>
                This goes without saying... but to be transparent.... DO NOT...
                Shoot people and down people when the server reset time is
                approaching... The player items drop when they are downed... and
                if that happens... they wont be able to recover them... This
                would be consider RDM/TDM/DEATHMATCHING...
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>Bicycles</h3>
              <p>
                Bikes are intended for 1 Person only... With the exception being
                a downed player needing immediate medical support. DO NOT
                TRANSPORT/CARRY/ESCORT players who are capable of moving on
                their own, in RP.... This includes people who are AFK. This will
                be considered a rule break for any/all parties involved in a
                situation like this!
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>Fallen Player/Loot Bag</h3>
              <p>
                If a player has fallen or been downed OUTSIDE of conflict
                (meaning accidental death, falling, etc.) and the body is
                visibly near the bag. NO ONE is allowed to grab that persons bag
                with the intention of looting. The only time you are allowed to
                grab another players bag is when you are in direct conflict with
                them, in a shootout, OR you are lifting a bag up to help them
                back to a sanctuary or doctor. A fallen player is NOT free loot,
                especially if you were not involved in the situation to begin
                with. If there is a random bag and you have done your due
                diligence to search for the bags owner in the near area, that
                bag is lootable.
